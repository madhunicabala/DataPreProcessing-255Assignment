# DataPreProcessing-255Assignment
This contains 3 parts of the home assignment .

For all three parts of the Home Assignments, I have provided two ways to access the work:
Option 1:
 You can directly view the IPYNB solution files along with the cleansed datasets (generated during execution on my local machine). These files are available on GitHub and also included in a ZIP folder uploaded here.
Option 2:
 If youâ€™d like to see the live output or re-run all cells, please follow the steps below.


The datasets are loaded from the GitHub URL, so you can easily execute the IPYNB solution files in Colab (or Jupyter) without needing my local files.


Open research.collab.google.com  and choose the option GitHub and Give this repository URL to access the datasets, cleaned datasets and Collab Files. 
https://github.com/madhunicabala/DataPreProcessing-255Assignment 



Open any Colab file and run it independently. Since all datasets are stored in the GitHub repository, the notebook will automatically fetch them and process the data.

 You also have the option to save the generated cleansed datasets locally. Even if you choose to skip saving, you can still validate the results by using the pre-uploaded cleaned datasets (from my previous runs).

Note that, All the collab files have all the output in the cells and appropriate TEXT cells for the explanations asked in LP/HP questions.
